                    <p>
                        I am a creative Software Engineer based in Dallas, TX with a passion for applying new cutting-edge technologies to enhance the innovative atmosphere of a business.

                        My interest in web development started in 2016 when I built my very first business website using custom themes and editing the html and css. After that, I created websites for family and friends then began as a freelancer part-time.

                        In the last 3 years, I've had the privilege of working as an Executive Admin Assistant where I worked hand-in-hand with the Software Engineering Department to review and give feedback for healthcare database structures and I designed custom marketing materials such as global weekly newsletters, email campaigns, and websites.

                        Fast-forward to today, my recently finished Full-Stack Software Engineering program experience with Flatiron School has shaped my coding knowledge with object-oriented programming, user interfaces, wireframes, Javascript, Ruby, Rails, among other areas. Iâ€™m excited to combine my experience in business administration and entrepreneurship with my software development skills!
